**RMRS Raster Utility** is an object oriented coding library that facilitates a wide range of spatial and statistical analysis using our newly developed [Function Modeling](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/raster-utility/function-modeling/) framework. Our library focuses on significantly reducing processing time and storage space associated with analyzing large datasets and has an easy to use graphical user interface, packaged as an ESRI add-in toolbar.

The RMRS Raster Utility toolbar plugs directly into ESRIâ€™s ArcMap and provides quick access to a variety of tools that streamline and simplify [Data Acquisition](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/raster-utility/tools/?tab=1), [Sampling](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/raster-utility/tools/?tab=2), [Raster Analysis](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/raster-utility/tools/?tab=3) and [Statistical Modeling](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/raster-utility/tools/?tab=4).
