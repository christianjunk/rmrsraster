                <li class="style5">Because all raster cells within the view extent must be processed 
                    on the fly. The Focal Analysis exacerbates this issue because each cell is processed 25 times (window size of 5 by 5).</li>
                <li class="style5">Because raster statistics are not calculated until the user 
                    specifies.</li>
                <li class="style5">Function Modeling reduces both processing time and storage space 
                    using delayed reading techniques. This means that for a given spatial model no 
                    processing time or storage space needs to be allocated to in and out (IO) 
                    procedures (writing to disk) and that intermediate datasets do not need to ever 
                    be created.</li>

                <li class="style5">Your results will vary depending on the shape and location of you 
                    management polygon. For our 31.97 acre management polygon we estimate a total of 
                    962.99 bole tons.</li>
                <li class="style5">&nbsp;Using a conventional modeling methodology 6 intermediate 
                    raster datasets would have been created to run the zonal statistics. If you 
                    combine this model with the model that helps identify cells in need of 
                    management then a total of 15 intermediate dataset would be created.</li>
                <li class="style5">Yes, the raster surface appears to be displaying correctly. 
                    Remember, after we created saved the function model we built statistic thereby 
                    persisting those values.&nbsp; </li>
