                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2010, RMRS scientists began a 
                research collaboration with Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management 
                personnel to quantify landscape-level above ground biomass and the potential 
                biomass flows resulting from restoration/fuel reduction treatments on the 
                Uncompahgre Plateau in western Colorado. As part of the project, we developed a 
                scalable .net library of innovative GIS tools built around Environmental Systems 
                Research Institute (ESRI) ArcGIS software. Our .net library was designed using 
                an Object-Oriented architecture, making it easy to modify and adapt to new 
                applications. This system, referred to as the “RMRS Raster Utility”, consists of 
                numerous user forms, multiple ESRI commands, and one ESRI toolbar, amounting to 
                more than 40,000 lines of code (Figure 1). The RMRS Raster Utility is 
                a free tool, packaged as an ESRI add-in for easy installation and operation. RMRS Raster Utility requires ArcGIS Desktop 
                10 binaries and can be ran under Engine or ArcView licensing levels.

            Designed around these user-friendly spatial analysis tools, we have created an 
            easy to use modeling framework that allows users to combine multiple spatial 
            operations into one <a href="FunctionDatasets.htm">function dataset</a>. This framework is accessible to users 
            through one intuitive form (i.e. window) that can be used to view, sample, 
            store, and manipulate datasets in a fraction of the time it takes to perform 
            similar analysis using standard raster modeling techniques.<br /><br />

            Figure 1. Using RMRS Raster Utility toolbar Function Modeling form (F1) we were able to quickly, 
            easily, and efficiently combine and transform probabilistic raster datasets into 
            multiple spatially explicit predictive surfaces. Next, using our Cluster Sample 
            Raster form (F2), we were able to relate FIA sample data to those predictive 
            surfaces via the spatial coordinates of the FIA plot locations. Finally, using 
            our sampled surfaces and the Model Regression and Create Regression Surface(s) 
            forms (F3 and F4, respectively), we were able to build a multivariate regression 
            model and apply that model to our predictive surfaces to create 4 raster 
            datasets depicting QMD (quadratic mean diameter), BAA (basal area per acre), TPA 
            (trees per acre), and AGB (above ground biomass).
