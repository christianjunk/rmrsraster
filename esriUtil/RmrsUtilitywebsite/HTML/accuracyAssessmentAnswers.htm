                <li class="style5">In the modeling stage of the analysis. Sample weights are used to 
                    weight the importance of each sample related to its natural distribution across 
                    the landscape.</li>

                <li class="style5">Yes the result are different. While chi-square, LL, and K are all 
                    significant their values are substantially different compared to using the 
                    weight and K is now statistically different between the two datasets at 
                    (alpha=0.05). Moreover class probabilities are no longer similar between the 2 
                    datasets. This result indicates the importance of a representative sample and 
                    how sampling weights can be used to achieve this representative sample; </li>
                <li class="style5">Training = Clust raster surface and Validation = CCCD raster 
                    surface.</li>
                <li class="style5">Because they both represent the same population, the pixels 
                    within the study area. The difference is simply how those pixels where initially 
                    grouped together (i.e., the weights). By weighting each sample&#39;s importance 
                    relative to the proportion of area that grouping consumes within the 
                    population, both sample schemes end up accurately representing the population (the 
                    pixels within the study area).</li>

            <ol>
                <li class="style5">Because map accuracy is one mean estimate of the probability of 
                    accurately identifying a pixel across the study area. Without confidence limits 
                    you do not have a good idea of the range of values that mean estimate can have 
                    (i.e., precision to the estimate).</li>
                <li class="style5">Map class 12 has a user error of 6.41% - 8.72% and 7.19% - 9.62% 
                    for categories 5 and 14, respectively. While mean point error estimates are 
                    different (7.56% and 8.41%), 95% confidence intervals overlap suggest that the 
                    error rate is not statistically different at the alpha = 0.05 level. This means 
                    that when the maps says a pixel is class 12, it is equally likely that a 
                    misclassification will occur between classes 5 and 14.</li>
                <li class="style5">The same way as explained in the answer for question 2 except 
                    that now you are concerned with the accuracy/error rates specifically between 2 
                    classes such as 12 and 5 as opposed to looking at the error rates between two 
                    categories given a mapped class. For example, mapped class 12 has a user 
                    accuracy ranging from 54.94% to 59.26%, while class 5 has a user error rate 
                    ranging from 6.41% - 8.72%. Clearly, there is a statistical difference in 
                    between these 2 classes at the alpha=0.05 level (mapped classes can also be 
                    compared using producer accuracies). Note, these probabilities could also be 
                    compared using odds and the linear logit equations.</li>

                <li class="style5">mean accuracy = 77.17%; lower and upper 90% confidence limits = 
                    76.90% and 77.44%</li>
                <li class="style5">mean accuracy = 77.17%; lower and upper 90% confidence limits = 
                    76.85% and 77.50%</li>
                <li class="style5">Yes, 95% CI do not overlap. The subset is more accurate then the 
                    full map.</li>
